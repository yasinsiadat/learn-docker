## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Follow in order:** Each section builds on previous knowledge
2. **Type commands yourself:** Don't just copy-paste, understand each command
3. **Experiment:** Try modifying examples and see what happens
4. **Clean up:** Use `docker system prune` to free up disk space
5. **Read error messages:** Docker's error messages are usually helpful

## 🛠️ Useful Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Container Management
docker run <image>              # Run a container
docker ps                       # List running containers
docker ps -a                    # List all containers
docker stop <container>         # Stop a container
docker rm <container>           # Remove a container
docker logs <container>         # View container logs

# Image Management
docker images                   # List images
docker pull <image>             # Download an image
docker build -t <name> .        # Build an image
docker rmi <image>              # Remove an image

# Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d            # Start services
docker-compose down             # Stop services
docker-compose logs -f          # Follow logs
docker-compose ps               # List services

# System
docker system df                # Show disk usage
docker system prune             # Clean up resources
```
